<p style="text-align:center;">So ever since I tried this dish in the <a href="http://sophie-amelia.com/2018/01/31/the-flying-pig-bowness-on-windermere-restaurant-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake District</a>, it’s been the go-to dish in our house. It’s healthy, quick, and tastes absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">As I’m not a big fish lover myself, this is a great way for me to integrate fish into my meals. I’ve lost count of how many times we’ve tried this homely meal, and I think I shall be making this all year round. It’s a great dish to enjoy around the fire on a cold winter evening but will also be great to enjoy sat outdoors in the garden with a cold glass of vino.</p>

<p>The ingredients for this dish are pretty simple and it also very easy to make! The sauce usually makes 4 portions, so we usually tub up the remaining 2 portions and cook another x2 fresh fish fillets when we next use up the sauce.</p>
<p><strong>The ingredients are as follows (serves 2/4):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>x2 fresh fish fillets – We use either cod, haddock or pollock. I don’t say fresh to be poncy, but I’ve tried making this dish several times with frozen fish and it just shrinks right up!</li>
<li>x2 tins of chopped tomatoes</li>
<li>Approximately 80g of chorizo</li>
<li>x1 tin of chickpeas (or butterbeans – both work great!)</li>
<li>x1 tin of kidney beans</li>
<li>A handful of cashew nuts</li>
<li>x2 tbsp Tomato purée</li>
<li>x1 tsp Worcester sauce</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees ready to cook your fish</li>
<li>Place your fish in a sheet of foil and garnish with your chosen dressing. We sometimes like to keep it simple and just squeeze some lemon on with a knob of butter, other times we use a <a href="https://www.maggi.co.uk/products/so-tender/lemon-dill-salmon/">Maggi So tender Lemon and Dill</a> paper. Once your desired dressing is applied, close up the foil and put the fish in the oven for approximately 20 minutes (or until fish is thoroughly cooked and flakey)</li>
<li>Whilst the fish is cooking, start making your sauce by pouring the chopped tomatoes, tomato purée and Worcester sauce into a large saucepan. Drain the kidney beans and chickpeas/butterbeans and add these in the sauce and leave to simmer and reduce. Chop your chorizo into small chunks and add this in also.</li>
<li>When your fish is about 5 minutes away from ready, take a handful of cashew nuts and toast them lightly using a frying pan. We cook these until they have a black scorched edge which creates a really nice crunch and flavour.</li>
<li style="text-align:center;">Plate up your sauce into a plate or bowl and lay your fish on the top. Sprinkle your toasted cashew nuts along the top.<img class="alignnone  wp-image-2396" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snapseed-38.jpg" alt="snapseed-38" width="458" height="610" /><br />
Voila! You’re all good to get munching. As I like to track my calories using my<a href="http://sophie-amelia.com/2017/07/21/calorie-counter-review-lose-it-app/"> Lose It! App</a>, I’ve calculated that this meal comes to around 364 calories using the ingredients above for the sauce split into 4 meals. If you choose to portion these ingredients into x2 portions, then this will obviously be doubled. I’ve honestly lost count of how many times we have cooked this meal as it has become one of our weekly meals that I look forward to every single time!</p>
<p>I’d love to know your thoughts on this recipe, feedback on if you try it or any tips and advice on how this dish or any others can be improved!</p>
