<p style="text-align:center;">Bloating is a common digestive problem in a lot of people, and I’m on a mission to try and find a solution to beat the bloat!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">As I’ve mentioned in <a href="http://sophie-amelia.com/2017/07/14/bootea-28-day-teatox-review/">previous articles</a> in regards to my constant struggle with bloating – another suggested solution that I’ve found is a certain smoothie concoction, which includes a range of ingredients that are known for busting the gut bloat.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">It is recommended that this smoothie is taken after an evening meal before bed each evening, and first thing in the morning you will notice significant reduce in bloating.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I trialled this smoothie for 2 weeks, and here’s how I got on.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align:center;">
<li style="text-align:left;">Half a banana</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Half a cup of almond milk</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">1 teaspoon of crushed almonds</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">1 teaspoon of grated ginger</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_3075.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-653" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_3075.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="4032" /></a><br />
This recipe states that all ingredients to be mixed into a blender, and to consume the drink half an hour after your dinner, and to not eat anything after it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>First Impressions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Whilst the ingredients didn't sound too appealing to me, it didn't actually taste <em>that</em> bad. As the measurements given only produce 1 small smoothie, I doubled these measurements so that I didn't have to re-make the mix the following night. As I'm not a big fan of ginger, I found a teaspoon of this very overpowering, however I stuck to it to see the full results.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_3087.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-654" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_3087.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="3780" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Results after 2 weeks</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">When I suffer from my bloating, unlike most people's flare ups, mine doesn't necessarily go down on it's own by the next morning. The first few days taking this smoothie, I didn't see a difference in the bloat and still felt pretty horrendous. After about day 4, I did wake up with a flat stomach, however my stomach does like to blow up for a few days on end and then all of a sudden go flat - so I can't honestly attribute this to the smoothie.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Personally, I wouldn't take this again for bloating, however it provided a healthy, quick and tasty smoothie for my breakfast each morning instead (once I reduced the intake of ginger put into it). I used to use my <a href="https://ninjakitchen.eu/uk/product/nutri-ninja-personal-blender-900w-bl450uk-silver/?gclid=CjwKCAjwxJnNBRAMEiwA8X_-QbWkcK95A5qVQWYU6fmIEg6d9iDhdnxitZDPf0keSBDtFZl-nc5WLhoCyFsQAvD_BwE">Nutri Ninja </a>every morning to make berry smoothies - however found out that I was actually just putting sugar into my body, and actually needed a vegetable smoothie instead.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This has honestly been the only smoothie I have enjoyed that isn't packed full of sugary fruits, and whilst I didn't notice a change in my bloating, all of the ingredients are healthy and work in other ways to keep my body going.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>This smoothie is said to improve your digestion by contracting your abs, allowing it to remove accumulated food residue, as well as fat deposits and gases from your intestines.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Bananas – Contain numerous vitamins and minerals as well as fiber called pectic, which improves your digestion and help you feel full for longer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Almond Milk – Adds texture and substance to your smoothie, whilst having more health benefits than skimmed milk. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Cinnamon Powder – This spice can reduce pressure on the abdomen by encouraging the passage of gas.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Crushed Almonds – The website I found this recipe off doesn’t actually state why these ingredients are beneficial to reducing bloating.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Ginger – A natural weight loss ingredient to reduce belly fat.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I'd recommend trying this smoothie for yourselves, and let me know what you think!</p>
