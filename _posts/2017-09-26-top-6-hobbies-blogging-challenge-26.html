<p style="text-align:center;">Having a hobby or interest is great for setting yourself goals, or even just for something to do! I do wish I had more hobbies, however these will have to do for now:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Photography</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I do love taking photos, or people, scenery, objects, anything! However, since leaving college and university where I had ongoing photography projects to complete and encouraging my creativity, I’ve found myself getting a bit lazy with it. I feel it’s not as acceptable anymore to dress my friends up in weird outfits and get them to pose in weird places without using the excuse ‘its for a project’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pexels-photo-226243.jpeg" alt="Image result for photography" width="470" height="294" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Walking</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I’m not an extreme hiker, and you will never see me climbing up a mountain – however I do love a nice enjoyable stroll through the woods. Whether this be by myself with my headphones in mulling life over, walking the dog, or having a catch up with friends. I can walk for miles without even realising that I’m actually doing exercise that I’m enjoying!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/RS15085_516313981-scr1.jpg?w=630&amp;h=420&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89" alt="Related image" width="462" height="308" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Blogging</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This is obviously quite a new hobby as my blog is only 3 months old, but I’m so glad that I decided to start this blog. Sometimes when I feel slugging and lazy, and tbh a little bit fed up – but my blog keeps me going, it encourages me to create new recipes and try new products to help others, and it encourages me to get my <em>ass</em> off the sofa and get out and do something worth blogging about.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Interior Pinning</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Is this a hobby…? Who knows – but I find myself spending hours on a weekly basis pinning interior design inspiration on my Instagram and Pinterest. I would love to be able to get creative with a house and unlimited budget…and tbh, I do sometimes wonder why I never went into interior design</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4434.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1383" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_4434.png" alt="" width="379" height="678" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Graphic Designing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Similar to my photography, this is something I’ve felt myself slipping away from since leaving education – however I still enjoy designing my <a href="http://www.sophie-amelia/prints" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prints</a> for myself and others, and my house is absolutely covered in funny or inspiration quotes and images.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4197.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1384" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_4197.jpg" alt="" width="396" height="496" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shopping</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Before you tell me no, <em>of course</em> this is a hobby. Online or walking around the shops, I could spend HOURS both clothes and house shopping. Whether this be putting an outfit together, or a display in the house – if I had unlimited money this would be the best hobby ever.</p>
