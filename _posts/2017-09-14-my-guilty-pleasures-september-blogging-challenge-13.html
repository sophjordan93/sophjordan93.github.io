<p style="text-align:center;">Hmm…well I’m pretty sure everyone has a bucket load of guilty pleasures, so I guess I’d better try and whittle it down!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Pizza &amp; Prosecco</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The best combination in the world. I could be in any sort of mood, yet if I hear pizza and prosecco…I’m there. I’m still on the hunt for a bottomless pizza and prosecco session in Hull, however sadly I don’t think it’s quite caught up with the likes of cities such as Leeds and Manchester.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4226.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1130" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_4226.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="692" /></a> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>James Blunt</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I feel like I’m out on my own with this one, but I just absolutely love James Blunt. Maybe not him so much as a person, but I love his songs and lyrics. C’mon, how can you not like Goodbye My Lover?!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4227.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1131" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_4227.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="610" /></a> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>A candlelit bubble bath with wine</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">There’s nothing more relaxing than running a hot bath overflowing with bubbles, and sinking in with some relaxing music and sipping on a glass of wine. I haven’t really done this yet this year as the weathers been too warm, but I can’t wait to come in from work on a winters night and just <em>relax.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4228.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1132" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_4228.jpg" alt="" width="1321" height="994" /></a><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Harry Potter</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">What a series of books and films. Whilst I have to admit, I did start to switch off after The Goblet Of Fire, the first 4 films and books I can watch and re-read time and time again. I’m always up for watching a good Harry Potter film, and have also got my eyes on some Hazza P Pj’s…</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_3449.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1133" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_3449.png" alt="" width="750" height="1334" /></a><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Late night Mcds’s runs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">To be honest…we haven’t done this in a while as I’m really trying to nail on my healthy eating – but the Mr and I got into a habit of eating our evening meal, and then around 9pm giving each other <em>the look</em> and hopping into the car for a late night Mcdonalds run. I have to say, I am ashamed of this one.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Braless</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">There is nothing more satisfying than getting home and whipping off that bra that's been cutting into you all day, don't even try to argue with me on this one. I will avoid underwear at all costs, as quite frankly it's just uncomfortable! If I can get away without my nipples poking your eye out, then god damn it's happening.</p>
