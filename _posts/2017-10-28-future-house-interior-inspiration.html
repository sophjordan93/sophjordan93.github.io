<p style="text-align:center;">So I’ve been very absent at the minute on my blog (Okay, very absent), but I’ve had a busy few weeks of working, socialising, having some ‘me’ time, and most importantly – House Hunting.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">As I mentioned in a previous post, the Mr and I discovered that we are able to buy our first home together, and therefore have spent the past few weeks visiting new build developments, analysing floor plans and drooling over show homes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Whilst this is still a year away, I’ve got far too excited about interior design, so I’ve been pinning interior ideas for a variety of rooms that are just absolute goals.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Kitchen</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">So at the minute I can't stop fantasising about kitchens. Don't get me wrong, my current kitchen isn't the worst - however it's a very basic white wash kitchen, no colour, no unique touches, and the images below are just the absolute dream. I'm loving the dark blue work tops, teamed with all the copper. Whilst I think the white worktops work best with the blue, I would probably opt for the wood as seen in the second photo as I think it would be easier to clean, and also a lot bloody cheaper! The copper tap with the black handles gives a really unique look to the room, and can we please just appreciate the copper pipe bottle and glass holder from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/CopperandCloth58" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copper and Cloth</a> - I'm already imagining the mass amount of gin and prosseco bottles that shall be stored here.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Living Room</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Now this is the room that I'm struggling with the most. The whole 'country feel' has been an interior style I've always loved, with the tartan chairs, cosy fire and big wooden storage trunks as tables. However, as we're looking to buy a new build home, I'm not too sure how this would work - would it look totally out of place? does anyone have any advice? I've had a look around at contemporary living room interior, and I do love the look below in the first picture with the neutral colours, fluffy rugs and a swarm of cushions - however I can't help but pine over my tartan and stag heads. I also had to throw a drinks trolley in there, as one of these to sit in the corner is a must.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Bedroom</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Whilst I love bright colours and patterns, I think a bedroom should be a calm, warm and relaxing space. I love the use of neutral colours throughout the bedroom, with the pale greys contrasting with the pink (however this does also clash with my contemporary living room idea, another reason why I want my tartan). I love the combination of funky lamps and a variety of prints above the bed, and that Chanel barrel table is to die for. I love the leaf print feature wall with the dark coloured cushions, however this is something that I would put in a guest bedroom.</p>
