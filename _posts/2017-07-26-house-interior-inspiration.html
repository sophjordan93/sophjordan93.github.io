<p style="text-align:center;">Iâ€™m forever spending hours on Instagram, pinning pretty house interior designs and shoving my phone in family and friends faces to show them â€“ So I thought, why not show you lot too?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Iâ€™m currently living in a rented property, and although I have decorated a few rooms, my perfect house with my favourite dÃ©cor is still waiting. A girl can dream.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_2926.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-327" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_2926.png" alt="" width="750" height="733" /></a><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Living Room</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Iâ€™m very indecisive when it comes to choosing a living room design. However lately Iâ€™ve been digging dark grey walls, framed prints and statement accessories. I just <em>love</em> the bold colours and prints in the first snap, however I think the stags (snap 6) make a great feature wall.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Bedroom</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Iâ€™ve seen hundreds of bedroom interior ideas that Iâ€™ve looked through and loved. However, to me a bedroom is somewhere comfortable and peaceful. Calm white walls and bedding makes this room like tranquil, the only addition I would make is to throw in some fairy lights in there!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Office</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Now this is something that I am desperate to have. Although I have a spare bedroom for it (which is currently my clothes room), I still need to acquire a desk, chair, and accessories to match. I currently blog from my sofa, dining table, and sometimes even the bath â€“ so to have a little space like this decorated exactly how I want is the dream. I think this is another thing to wait for until I own a house.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Outdoor Area</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I absolutely adore this outdoor area. Itâ€™s so simple and chic, yet the contrast of the statement floor tiles really bring this area together. This looks like the perfect place to cuddle up on a summers evening with a book, or relax with the Mr or the girls with a nice bottle of wine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Bathroom</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Oh the bath, look at the bath. If my bathroom looked like this, I would literally spend hours in it! Even though I think these tiles would be very high maintenance to clean, I think they bring a real class to the room. I have a bit of an obsession with free standing baths, so the fact I love this bath is a given. The ledge is great for putting toiletries on, but I love the idea that theyâ€™ve accessorised with it also.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Kitchen</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Similar to the living room, I love the idea of the dark grey/blue carrying on into the kitchen. The tiles used here are similar to the ones in my bathroom snap, and I think they also look great in here too. I like the idea of a brick feature wall in the kitchen-dining room (similar to what I have now), and the hanging bulbs they have are the absolute dream.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Hallways</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Iâ€™ve got a bit of a thing with hallways at the minute. Every house I look at on the internet up for sale, I will disregard if it doesnâ€™t have an awesome hallway space that I can transform into something like this. A hallway is the first thing people see when they enter your house, so itâ€™s got to look amazing, right?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Even though I drool over these interior design ideas, I've also got a few favourite spots in my own house that I've designed. It's not perfect, but it's all my small budget and rented accomodation will allow.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Dresser</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I absoloutely fell in love with this dresser from the moment I saw it. I found it in a vintage shop in Leeds, and it came complete with a dining table, bench and chairs. I love floating shelves with prints and accessories on, so to me this was perfect to have such a large place to display my bits and bobs. A lot of the items are gathered over time from christmas and birthday presents - The Hull Kingston Rovers sign however was hand made by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/daisydoodlecraft/?ref=br_rs">Daisy Doodle Crafts</a>, and can be made to any design you like. The print with various locations is a collection of places me and my partner have lived and travelled together - I created this myself, and can take orders for personalised prints for you also.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Fireplace</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Once again, a place to store all my bits. I've always loved the melted candlewax on champagne bottles, so when we finally got a fireplace like this where I was able to do this, I was over the moon. I saved my bottles from special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries, so I've made this space really personal to us. (Also featuring my graudation photo - yes, I got to wear the funky hat!). I especially love this area in winter when I've got the fire on and my candles lit, and it's extra cosy at christmas with my garland and christmas lights!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">If you have any inspiration ideas to share with me or just want to say hi, I'd love to hear from you all ðŸ’•</p>
