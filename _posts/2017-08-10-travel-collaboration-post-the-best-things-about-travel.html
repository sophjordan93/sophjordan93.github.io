<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>I’m super excited to announce my first even collaboration post. Kate and I both have an interest in travel, so we thought it would be a great idea to come together and write a post. Here’s an introduction piece that Kate wrote about herself and her blog:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://girlmasked.wordpress.com/">girlmasked.wordpress.com</a> is lifestyle and mental health blog. It has the occasional travel post and book review. I am hoping to branch into beauty product reviews sometime soon.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I have had this blog for a little over a year now and I am really enjoying improving my blog, posting and getting to know other bloggers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Aside from blogging in spare time I like to read and write poems. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends and learning new things. I love to bake and go on long walks in forests/beaches.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I really enjoyed doing this collab post with Sophie, it’s been fun and I hope to work with her again sometime.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>How many countries have you visited?<br />
</strong><br />
Me: I’m not sure off the top of my head, but from what I can remember approximately 15? This number needs making bigger!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Kate: Just two! Hungary and Italy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Which was your favourite country?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Me: It’s got to be Thailand, there was just something about it I can’t put my finger on. The food, the culture, the scenery – I spent nearly 2 months there, and I’m itching to go back!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_3305.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-472" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_3305.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_3303.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-473" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_3303.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Kate: Definitely Italy! We stayed in Lake Garda and then travelled to places like Verona and Venice. I loved it. There was something so magical about it! The scenery was amazing, so many different streets, mountains and flowers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>What 3 places are next on your bucket list to visit?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Me: Santorini, Italy and more parts of the USA.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Kate: London, Paris and Seville</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>What is your go-to travel necessity?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Me: It’s got to be a camera of some sort. Whether it’s my iPhone, Canon, or an underwater camera. Snapping photos on holiday is a must!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Kate: My camera too!! I take a crazy amount of photographs on holidays! Probably a book and notebook too with a pen to keep me occupied on long journeys!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Where are you going on your next travels?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Me: I’m heading off for a weekend in Amsterdam in November for my birthday, it’s somewhere I’ve always wanted to go!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Kate: I have no idea, I’ve no plans!! I’d love to go to London next and travel around the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;<strong>What is your go to summer holiday outfit?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Me: I need to find a summery, floaty dress for every holiday. <em>Without fail.<br />
</em><br />
Kate: Simple shorts and t- shirt with my favourite runners and a bracelet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>What’s the best thing you’ve ever bought in another country?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Me: This is so hard, as I love to bring stuff back with me. It’s got to be between my beloved red furry gilet from NYC, my hand-made customised jewelled ring from India, and my underwater phone pouch I bought in Mexico.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Kate: A small mask based on the Comedia Del Arte Style masks which I bought in Italy last year and it is hanging on my wall.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I hope you enjoyed our collaboration post. I've thoroughly enjoyed doing this and would love to work with more bloggers! Get in touch :)</p>
