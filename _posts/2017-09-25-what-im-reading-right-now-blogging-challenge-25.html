<p style="text-align:center;">I've not actually been reading anywhere near as much lately, as to be quite honest by the time I get home and write my blog and watch my TV programmes, I'm just bloodyÂ <em>knackered</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">However, one that I've been getting my teeth stuck into lately is Hot Mess by Lucy Vine. It's basically a take on Bridget Jones, but it's not Bridget Jones. A new character, a new plot, but with a lovable and relatable character just like B.</p>
<p>I've still not finished this book, and I don't want to give away the plot in case any of you read it (<em>which I would recommend</em>), but this book has had me laughing throughout.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">One of my most favourite books that I've ever read has got to be Me Before You - Jojo</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Moyes. I read the book before the film, and absolutely loved the both of them. I loved reading the book first to envisage the characters, how they look, how they sound - and then to see how a film was created from the book was brilliant.</p>
