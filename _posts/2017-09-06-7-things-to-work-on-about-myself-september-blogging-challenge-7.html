<p style="text-align:center;">Without making this sound too much of a bleak post – there’s a few things about myself that I need to work on. But hey, doesn’t everyone?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>My self confidence</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Inside and out, my number one improvement I need to work on has got to be my self-confidence. I’ve always had a confidence issue with my weight and appearance, and it’s something that I’m working on. I’m aware that I’m not obese or repulsive, and this isn’t a cry for attention either. I’m just not too happy with the way my body looks in comparison to the rest of the Instagram population with their rock hard abs and peachy booty’s. My self-confidence issues don’t just stop at weight however, as I’m always doubting myself on what I can achieve or what I’m capable of – however writing my post on things I’m proud of achieving recently, this is definitely improving.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>My weight and fitness</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Tying in with my point above, although I hate my weight – I need to do more about it. When I was at University I was a regular gym goer, actively walking to university and back and eating well. Now I’m in a full-time office job, feeling sluggish and now living with my partner who enjoys a takeaway night in just as much as I do. Working on this lifestyle change will also bump my self-confidence back up – so it’s a win win!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Picking up a new hobby</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I will openly put my hands up and say that I’m a very needy person – and when people close to me are busy, or unavailable to hang out, this seriously gets me down. I’ve encouraged myself to take up new hobbies and learn to enjoy some <em>me</em> time. I’m already making progress on this as my blog and print designing is keeping me more than occupied!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Create an inspirational room </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">As you may have read in my house inspiration posts – although I’ve decorated a few rooms to my tasting, I feel like I don’t have a place I can throw my full creativity at. There’s so many interior styles that I keep tucking aside, and I walk around the shops going ‘ooh I love that’ or ‘ooh that would look great in this room with that’ – yet I never actually go through with it and do it. This may not happen until I own my own house, but I’m gunna make it happen!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Be more outgoing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Has anyone ever seen the film, Yes Man? I am basically the Jim Carey before he is converted into saying yes to every event. I’ve become so happy and absorbed in my little home that a lot of the time going out and doing things is really unappealing. Each day should be lived to the full, and I’ve realised that I need to stop being a hermit – and saying yes to more opportunities. You never know what may come of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Improve my cooking skills</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Whilst I wouldn't say I'm a bad cook, I'm also not the most fantastic either. I can cook up the classics such as a chilli con carne or fajitas, however I've noticed that I use quite basic ingredients and need to improvise and just experiment! As the weathers got colder, I've started making a range of soups at the moment as they are quick, healthy and hearty meals. My current winner has to be my butternut squash and red pepper soup with chilli flakes, I'm slowly but surely getting there!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Read more and relax</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I've always been a book worm, and can spend hours with my head shoved in a book. I always used to love taking a long, hot bubble bath with my kindle and a glass of wine and spend time unwinding - or even tucking up in bed and having a quick read before bed. Since working full time however, I've found that I'm just exhausted all the time that I don't actually have the time or energy to read anymore. When I go on holiday I absolutely fly through books, however at home I'm too busy watching the latest programme or making tea that I've forgotten how to set time aside to treat myself.</p>
