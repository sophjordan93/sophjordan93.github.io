<p style="text-align:center;">Another life in the day of Sophie Amelia…well – I’m actually quite excited about this one! My last DITL post was basically me boring you lot about my gym schedule/day at work. However today is SATURDAY and I’ve actually had a very eventful day.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Today started off with a 7:30 alarm to take my car in for it’s MOT…<em>cry cry</em> – where’s the weekend lie in’s at?! All set to go by myself to drop off Nora (Nora the Nissan) and walk to the gym to waste the morning, it was a lovely surprise when the Mr got up with me and suggested to go for breakfast – Breakfast&gt;Gym = <em>result!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">We dropped Nozza off and left in a hire car, a little Kia Seed. I must admit, after driving around in a 15 year old car that is falling to bits, I was ever so tempted to stay in this hire car and not return…but I obviously didn’t.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">We went for a drive to the local café and I got my absolute favourite – eggs benedict. Mmm…</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4317.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1307" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_4317.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="4032" /></a><br />
With many discussions and plenty of times driving past the new houses currently being built in the area, we decided to go for a nosy. We realised we would be in a position to buy in a few years, so it wouldn’t hurt to look.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Hours later, arms loaded with brochures and conversations with mortgage advisors – we realised that we could be looking to buy a lot sooner than we thought, and for a lot nicer house too! Eep! For those who have read my interior design post and how much I pine over having a house that I own to decorate – you will realise how bloody excited I was to hear this news.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">We walked around show homes, we discussed prices and help to buy schemes, and you know what, what a bloody fantastic afternoon! We eventually decided to call it a day and went to retrieve our little Nora, who of course, failed the MOT. BUT, I didn’t really care – BECAUSE WE CAN BE HOMEOWNERS NEXT YEAR.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Can we just asses how beautiful these show rooms are - I officially need this bedroom and kitchen in my life)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4321.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1310" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_4321.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="4032" /></a><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4341.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1309" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_4341.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1600" /></a><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4339.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1308" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_4339.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">We headed over to Lidl and got some German Bratwurst sausages, onions and baguettes for a Christmas market inspired dinner (we couldn’t wait until November), and I’m now sat munching on my hotdog, sipping a glass of wine and about to choose a film for a fantastic Saturday night in.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4351.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1321" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_4351.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I hope you all enjoyed your Saturday too!</p>
