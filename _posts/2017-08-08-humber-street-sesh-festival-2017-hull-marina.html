<p style="text-align:center;">So, first things first – Humber Street Sesh was <em>amazing</em> as it is every year.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I was hoping to write a really detailed post on this like my Great British Food Festival one, discussing each food stall and everything that was on offer – unfortunately, too many gin’s and ciders can make a girl’s memory slight cloudy. Hey, I’m only human!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">What I can say though, is that attending this yearly festival is a MUST.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_31941.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-429" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_31941.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="3780" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Hosted in one of the most beautiful parts of Hull – The Marina, the streets alongside the docks are filled with food stalls of all kinds, drink tents, and local talent all round.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Over the years, this part of Hull has grown significantly, with more swanky bars and restaurants – to fantastic bright and colourful graffiti sprayed all over the walls like large art murals.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Upon arrival, the atmosphere was already booming. The local bands had already begun playing, and everyone was out to enjoy themselves. Figures dressed up walked around posing for photos, giving a somewhat carnival feel, and everyone was spilling out onto the streets to drink in the ambience.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_3270.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-432" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_3270.png" alt="" width="2592" height="3888" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_3276-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-447" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_3276-1.png" alt="" width="2592" height="3888" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">With one large main stage playing right alongside the picturesque views, and another 17 others dotted around, there was certainly plenty to choose from. Although the place was full of fantastic talent, my favourite had to be the closing act on the ABP stage which was Bud Sugar.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">If you had had enough of watching bands, there was also a mini fun fair, several art spaces, and a silent disco. To say that the tickets were £10 bought in advance, there was so much to do here and definitely worth the money!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Whether this is a day out for all the family to bring the kids, or for a night out with friends – this event runs from 11am to 11pm, so is accommodating for all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Although this event has always been great, this year there were more pop-up bars which avoided long ques, and the security was doubled up making everyone feel safe and secure.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The tickets also gave you free entry to a few venues later on for an after party, so if you weren’t ready to go home – you didn’t have to!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The only negative thing I would say in regards to this has to be trying to get a taxi home – however this can easily be resolved by pre-booking beforehand.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">All in all, if you’re from Hull and you’ve never been – why not?! And if you aren’t – then this festival is worth traveling for.</p>
