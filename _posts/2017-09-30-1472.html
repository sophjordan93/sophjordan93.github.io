<p style="text-align:center;">I feel like I've done like a gazillion fact lists about me, so apologies if there are any repeats…but there are only so many ‘interesting’ things I can say about myself before I start to sound like a boring fart. Today also marks my 30<sup>th</sup> and final post of September – so let’s do this!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>I hate being alone – Whilst most people crave the whole ‘<em>me’</em> time, I honestly just hate it. Maybe for like, 20 minutes to have a relaxing bath, but then I crave to be around other people, even if it’s just sitting together in silence.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>I enjoy reading. As mentioned in a previous post about my favourite books that I’m reading and how I don’t get to read as much as I’d like to anymore, I do enjoy a good book.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>I have freakishly long toes. I mean, I’ve never thought they were too bad – but I’ve had friends hold their hands next to my feet and take a picture claiming it looks like a pair of hands. Ah well, feet aren’t the prettiest things in the world anyways.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>I hate sport. I’m just really not a sporty person, and unfortunately for me – the Mr watches it on a daily basis. If I had to pick one that I don’t mind, I would go for boxing. But football and rugby…just no.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>I grew up going to private schools – although not that you could tell. I was suspended from one by throwing paint on the walls, and got caught fighting on the bus. That life just ain’t for me,</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Despite barely being able to ride a pushbike, I did actually take my moped test. Although I haven’t rode one since I’ve passed it!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>I’m a member of the mile high club (<em>oops – a lady never tells</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>I’m petrified of horses. I think they’re beautiful, but I just don’t trust the way they look at me. I attempted to feed one outside NY Central Park, however panicked as I saw it’s huge teeth, fell over onto the pavement, and just rolled around for a while – true friends style.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>I’ve been scuba diving and touched a wild leopard shark (I did absolutely shit myself, don’t be reading this thinking I’m an absolute hero).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>I used to play clarinet, and earnt a distinction for my grade 1 before I got bored and decided to give it up. I also took guitar lessons, and taught myself <em>Hey There, Delilah – Plain White Tees.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>I don’t mind a good old fishing trip. Whilst it’s probably associated with the opposite gender, my dad always used to take me and my brother to go fishing by the lakes – and I found it very relaxing and enjoyable way to spend the day.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>I cracked my head open running into a lamppost. Okay, I was only young so no judgement here – but I was showing off to my mum and nan showing them how fast I could run, looked behind to see if they were looking and DONG, straight into the post. Hello head stitches!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>I bought a new car today! It’s not the Audi that I’ve described in my previous posts as, however I am now the proud owner of a white Kia Rio!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>My favourite cocktail is a Pornstar Martini – who doesn’t love a fruity cocktail with a shot of prosecco?!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Probably mentioned before…but I’m a sucker for a good crime drama. Any suggestions to watch anyone?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>I have a tattoo between my shoulders that I got in Thailand, which was made using a bamboo stick with a needle in. I wanted a tattoo to remind me of my travels in Asia, so I decided on the co-ordinates of central Asia.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>There are so many talented actors and actresses out there, but my favourite has to be awarded to Denzel Washington, purely for his fantastic performance in <em>Man On Fire</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>I have a love for a pair of fantastic boots. I’m not usually a shoe fan, and my shoe collection is probably quite pathetic – but I am always in awe of a good pair of boots.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>I suck at bowling – something that I discovered last night. Yes, at the age of 23 I have always played with the barriers up. Since having my first game last night starting without them (My other halves family insisted I had to try without), I’ve realised I literally cannot play without them. They quickly went back up again...</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>My worst experience has got to be being stung by a poisonous jellyfish in Goa, India. I still have flashbacks of the pain, the hospital trips and just the whole aftermath.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>I’m absolutely petrified of heights. The Mr and I went to a water park in Abu Dhabi, and I sat at the top of the slides for a good 10 minutes on each one before I bottled up the courage to actually go down. It’s safe to say he wasn’t too impressed…</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>I used to have a lisp. It wasn’t <em>too</em> noticeable, but my year 3 school teacher used to make me repeat ‘seven sausages sizzling in a pan’ over and over again to try and cure it. I guess I never really noticed that it had just gone until just now writing this post!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>I think I’d have to say that my favourite country which I’ve visited so far would have to be Thailand.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>I can’t stand my feet being touched. I have the most ticklish feet in the world, and if someone grabs them without my being prepared, then they must accept the kick that is to follow.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>I love carrots and cucumbers, and I think they make a great snack replacement to dip into salad/dips instead of crisps or bread.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>If I could be anyone for the day – it would be Tim Walker. He’s my favourite photographer, and his photographs are extraordinary. To be able to have access to the budget and props that he does to make his creations come alive would be fantastic.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="27">
<li>My favourite pizza topping has got to be a Texas BBQ. Chicken, bacon, peppers, BBQ sauce, mmm…</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>I hate talking to strangers on the phone. I just hate the awkwardness, and I’m so grateful that sites like Just Eat exist so I can order a shit load of takeaway and not have to talk to a single soul.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>My dream job would be to travel the world and be paid to photograph and blog about the fantastic things that I see. This is deffs more a hobby, but if I could get paid to do this - I mean, wow!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>And finally, the big old’ 30 – I HAVE COMPLETED THE SEPTEMBER BLOGGING CHALLENGE. Whilst this certainly was a challenge, I’m so glad that I set myself this task and completed it. Whilst I won’t be able to keep up blogging as frequently as I have been, this challenge has encouraged me to write about things that I never would, and I hope It’s entertained you lovely lot too!</li>
