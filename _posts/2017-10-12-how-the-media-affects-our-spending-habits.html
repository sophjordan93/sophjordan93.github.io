<p style="text-align:center;">So, rather than the usual post regarding my day out or a new product that I’m trialing – I thought I would delve into how the media we are surrounded by controls or influences our spending habits.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">As you will all know if you have read my previous posts, <em>pizza is life</em>. However, with my recent attempt of trying to clean up my diet and cut down on the takeaways – I hadn’t actually ordered one in a few weeks, trust me, this is an achievement.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">It wasn’t until I was watching Tuesday nights Great British Bake Off (GBBO) and they announced that it was Italian week that my will power took a burn. After eating a healthy dinner of chicken and lentils, and feeling quite satisfied with my hunger, I sat down to watch that week’s episode.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">All of the food produced on the show looked delicious, including a variety of Italian pastries, <em>nom</em>. It wasn’t until it got onto the round of pizza making that I knew I was in trouble. My mouth was watering, my belly was rumbling, and all of a sudden – I had the most incredible desire to eat a pizza. Like I would without even second thought eat a second dinner of Pizza.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I didn’t give into my cravings this time – but the next day at work, conversation levels were high around the ever growing popular tv programme. With the pizza making challenge playing on my mind all day…the Mr and I both caved later on that night and ordered a Domino’s in all its glory.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I tucked into every mouthful without even considering where this idea had come from. It wasn’t until my recent look at Google Trends, that I realised the most searched conversation this week was all related to the GBBO, and the recipes featured in this week’s episode: Sfogliatelle, Margherita Pizza and Cannoli - and that made me realise that without know it, watching something on TV inspired me to make a purchase.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Domino’s email me on a regular basis with seasonable promotions and reactive real-time content, however surprisingly they actually missed a trick here by not jumping onto this clever marketing technique – similar to what Oreo did during the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/02/oreo-twitter-super-bowl/">Superbowl blackout</a>. They were however my first choice to go for due to a marketing email I had received and subconsciously observed a few days prior (<em>so they still win, really).</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Basically, my whole reason for this post is that the media has an impact on what we do on a regular basis, without us even realising. This includes online shopping, in which the browser uses your cookies to pretty much follow you across all devices and sites, taunting you with adverts on other websites and your social to encourage you to go back and buy that product. <em>That pretty dress that you nearly bought, but decided to be good and resist? Guess what, we want you to buy it, we don’t want you to resist, therefore you will see it EVERYWHERE until you can’t stop thinking about it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I find the whole aspect behind marketing fascinating, which is why I do it daily as my job. Whilst it’s scary what information the internet can store from each individual, what marketers and brands can do with it is even more interesting.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Chances are, every advert and every email you receive has been selected for you, based on your internet user habits and your shopper journey. Looking at flights or insurance? The companies <em>know that</em>, and chances are that they've recognised that you're interested in what they have to offer - and potentially even put the prices up the next time you go on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Top tip</strong>? If you're shopping around online, make sure you <em>clear your cookies</em> - you may find that you will get a lot cheaper deals! (<em>You're welcome)</em>.</p>
