<p style="text-align:center;">So this morning I received a lovely treat in the post – A sample for the new My Burberry Blush perfume.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I’m not usually one to buy a lot of perfume, as I usually get them for birthday/christmas or a rare treat to myself from the airport. Since it had been a while since I had mixed my perfumes up, I was excited to try the new Burberry scent.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">First impression – Well done Burberry. The envelope alone, made me feel like I had received a letter from royalty. Inside was a beautifully shaped perfume bottle cut out, with a personalised wrap around featuring my initials. This then opened out to display the perfume sample and elegant gold writing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Considering this was a free sample, Burberry really have nailed it with their marketing and the personalisation, which was a great touch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_3390.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_3390.png" alt="" width="945" height="756" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-485" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The perfume itself, was a very fruity and fragrant perfume – very similar to the sort of perfumes I love. Although this is a great perfume scent, I felt like it wasn’t very strong or stayed on my skin too long. I know this is hard to judge considering it was a rub on sample, however I’ve found other magazine rub on samples have had a stronger, longer lasting smell.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Retailing from £47 for the smallest size (30ml), this to me is quite expensive for such a small little bottle. Of course, it’s Burberry, it was never going to be cheap. However, it smells very similar to my previous favourite perfume <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.ebay.co.uk/b/amp/Intimately-Beckham-Eau-de-Toilette-for-Women/11848/bn_53774657">Intimately Beckham</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;which I believe has now been discontinued (sigh), but used to retail at around £20 for 30ml. I’m currently on the lookout for a new daily perfume retailing around the same price, so it anyone has any suggestions, please throw them my way!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">My favourite occasion perfume has got to be <a href="http://www.boots.com/chanel/chanel-ladies-fragrances/chanel-chance">Chanel – Chance</a>. Although this is expensive, this was a gift for Christmas 2 years ago, and I save this for special occasions such as evening do’s or posh meals. With about a third of the bottle left, it’s going to need replacing soon, but it’s definitely had a run for its money! With the tiniest of squirts, this scent stays on very well and goes very far, would definitely recommend.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I absoloutely love reviewing products, and always leave honest reviews. If you have any products you would like me to review, please get in touch!</p>
