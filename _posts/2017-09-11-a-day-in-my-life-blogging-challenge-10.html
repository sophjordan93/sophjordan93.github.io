<p style="text-align:center;">My days vary massively from week days to weekends – and seeing as there is another one of these posts to do in my 30-day blogging challenge I’ll start with my week days. I can’t see this being too interesting to be honest…but I’m making sure I stay to the blogging challenge checklist – so here goes guys!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5:50</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Alarm goes off…and with great difficulty, I get my ass up and get to the gym for 6:30. (For those reading thinking that I’m an absolute warrior and fitness enthusiast – I’m really not. If you read one of my <a href="http://sophie-amelia.com/2017/09/06/7-things-to-work-on-about-myself-september-blogging-challenge-7/">latest posts</a>, you’ll discover that I’ve only recently joined so let’s hope I can keep this up).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6:30</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Sleepily, I drag myself in the gym and do a 10-minute run on the treadmill, followed by a vigorous 10 minutes on the stepper to get that Beyoncé ass. I’d like to up both of these timings the more my body gets used to regular exercise – but for now, this will do. After I’ve done my cardio, I move onto a range of weights and ab exercises for an all over workout. I know most people will do a <em>leg day</em> or <em>arm day</em> but I like to keep working all parts of my body in each workout. Maybe I’m doing this wrong and someone will tell me I need to stop this – but it works for now. Today I did a few sets of kettle bell swings to tone my arms, legs and bum, followed by quite a few reps on the leg abductors, and then finally lifting weights to focus on my arms.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>7:20</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Back home for a quick shower, and to feed the very vocal cat and dog. I don’t usually spend much time getting ready for work as, well, I’m at work – I’m sat in an office and I have no one to impress. (This will differ if I have an important client meeting). If I haven’t sweated too much, I’ll usually put a bit of talc baby powder on my roots and give it a quick straighten through, but if there is just no rescuing it without washing – up in a messy bun it goes. Breakfast is either a homemade breakfast egg muffin or 2 soft boiled eggs to either eat before heading out the door or to take on the go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>7:55</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Time to hop into my little car and head off to work. I only live about 15 minutes away from work, so it’s not too much of a journey at all. Currently in my little Nissan Micra called Nora, off I scuttle to work. My next car in the pipeline is a white Audi A5 – a joint car for me and the Mr to share. I wanted a TT, he wanted an A7, so we compromised. I’ve told myself though that a new car isn’t happening until I work my way up to a new promotion – as even though we could perhaps afford it now, it’s important to have goals to work towards and reward yourself for reaching them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>8:15 – 5:00</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Work work work. There’s not really too much to say here as I know reading about somebody’s work day really isn’t the most exciting. My work day also varies so much so it’s hard to pinpoint a ‘usual day’ at work. Working in Content Marketing, I look at the recent trends and keyword research around popular trends, products and most talked about words or questions. I then apply this into the articles that I write, and can then write about stuff that people are actually interested in. My current clients that I work for are Argos Pet Insurance, KY and Durex – so as you can imagine, my days that consist of writing about furry animals and blowjobs aren’t exactly the dullest!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5:15</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Back home to once again feed the chowing pets, and straight into my PJs. I don’t usually do much on an evening after work as to be honest, I’m just pretty exhausted. Some nights I might go for a walk with a friend if the weather suits, or if I’ve not seen a friend in a while I’ll pop out for a tea or for a drink – but apart from that, I can’t say I do anything too wild. As the Mr is the main chef of the household, if he’s in before me I don’t really need to start prepping tea. After work is my time to catch up with my blog and write a new blog post, so I try to fit this in after dinner and before all my programmes begin.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>10:00</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Yep, this is usually the time I hit the hay. Whenever I speak to other people who say ‘<em>Oh, I had an early night last night – I went to bed about 11:30’</em>  - What?! This girl needs her sleep, and no amount of tv programmes is worth that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">So, there you have it, a typical day in the work life of Sophie Amelia! I do one day aspire to blog full time alongside being a full-time mummy, and have a day consisting of spending time with my little one and being able to put more time and effort into my blog. This is a long time off – but it’s good to look towards the future!</p>
