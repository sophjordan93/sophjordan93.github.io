<p style="text-align:center;">We all get to that point when we canâ€™t even remember what clothes we own, half of the ones that are hung up we donâ€™t even like anymore â€“ and them trousers that wonâ€™t button up anymore? Yep, you need to get rid.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">However, itâ€™s not that simple to just refresh your wardrobe is it? Unless of course, weâ€™re absolutely rolling in cash. But câ€™mon, weâ€™re not all the Kardashians! So lately Iâ€™ve been trying to think of a way to update my wardrobe, out with the old and in with the new. How have I done this you ask? The magical app that is Depop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Iâ€™ve never been one for associating myself with PayPal, and the thought of having to set up an Ebay account terrified me. It wasnâ€™t until a friend mentioned to me about the app Depop â€“ which is basically an easy Ebay to buy and sell your stuff. You set up a profile and can select people to follow, very similar to Instagram.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Once you have set up your profile and connected your PayPal account, youâ€™re free to get uploading. This is really easy, and you donâ€™t have to pay to upload like you do Ebay. Depop take a percentage of what you sell instead, so if you donâ€™t sell â€“ you donâ€™t get charged. You upload images, choose your price and delivery price, as well as write a description about your product.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Iâ€™ve set myself a task to use my account balance only. Basically, this means that whenever I sell something on my Depop, it will go straight into my PayPal account. If I then see something that another user is selling that I want to buy, I can then buy it â€“ but ONLY using the balance in my PayPal account. This technique has stopped me from spending willy-nilly, and also encouraged me to sell things that I would never detach myself from, but what I havenâ€™t worn in ages either. Found a gorgeous top but not sold enough to buy it? Tough! Keep raiding that wardrobe and keep uploading.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Of course, you could always sell your clothes using this app and then buy brand new clothes in the shops â€“ but that will be a lot more expensive and will till take you a lot longer to add up your PayPal balance. Buying clothes off Depop is clothes recycling, and sometimes includes clothes that are still brand new with tags on that people have just missed the 14-day return window. This technique is a great way for me to buy new clothes and still feel great, but Iâ€™m not dipping into any of my savings â€“ so I can look good and still save money for a house. Voila!

<p style="text-align:center;">Do you use Depop? Or do you have any other ways on how to update your wardrobe? I want to know! I would love to hear from you all in the comment section below ðŸ˜Š</p>
