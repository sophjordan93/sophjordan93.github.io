<p style="text-align:center;">Following on from my birthday celebrations (and being way too busy to of posted this any sooner), here's my review from my birthday meal at The Pipe and Glass Inn.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I've eaten here before, whether that be sat outside in the sunshine eating a ploughman's board, to chomping down on a beautiful Ox cheek steak. This time however was the first time that I had sampled the Sunday lunch menu - so decided to give it a review for you lovely lot!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Pipe and Glass Inn is a beautiful, country pub situated in South Dalton, Beverley. Awarded with a Michelin star, this pub/restaurant provides great service, friendly staff, and fantastic food every time. I want to start by saying that whilst I say I'm a foodie, I'm quite a wuss when it comes to trying new foods. However, thanks to the Mr, I'm getting braver and sampling beautiful food more and more. Here's what we had:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I started off with potted pork, sticky apple and crackling salad, sage butter and warm spelt toast. The potted pork came with an interesting looking green fat layer, however once you cracked past the jelly, the pork was so smooth and absolutely delicious. The purple jelly cubes that you can see on the bed of salad worked brilliantly with the pork and the spelt bread (whatever they were! Red onion? Beetroot?).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/snapseed-16.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1990" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snapseed-16.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="4032" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Dave had the Seared Isle of Mull scallops, roast butternut squash, black pudding fritter, and cider apple dressing off the specials board. I didn't actually sample any of this as I'm really not a seafood fan, but his input on this "Though aesthetically pleasing, this dish lacked in flavours. The scallops were small and lacked seasoning, and the butternut squash cubes didn't really deliver any new elements to the dish. Although the pumpkin seeds offered some texture, their flavouring was too strong and overpowered the scallops. Unfortunately, at £14 this dish will not be getting a return visit!"</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/snapseed-17.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1991" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snapseed-17.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="4032" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">For my main I had the Roast 30 day aged sirloin of Yorkshire reared beef<br />
with Yorkshire pudding and ‘Two Chefs’ ale gravy.  As I ordered this, the waitress asked 'It's cooked medium rare, is that okay for you?' Umm...yep! Any good bit of meat is ruined if cooked anything over! So this already set high expectations. The beef was cooked beautifully, as you can see by the pink colour to it, and the Yorkshire pudding was just amazing, I mean look at the size of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/snapseed-18.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1992" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snapseed-18.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="4032" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The gravy was rich and full of flavour, and to be honest if I had to make any criticism it would be that the roast potatoes were <em>too</em> crispy and a bit too tough to cut up and chew. However, I know to some people this would be heaven. The one thing that would improve this dish would be a roasted garlic bulb alongside the beef, as the two combined are my favourite flavours; however I really can't fault the plate and would definitely return again for this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Dave chose off the specials board again for his main, and opted for Roast mallard breast,<br />
confit leg, duck fat potato, honey and thyme roast beets, black trumpet mushrooms and Wiltshire truffle. I did actually try some of his main, and we both agreed that the charred spring onion was outstanding, and a winning element to the plate. The beetroot brought an earthiness to the dish which complimented the duck. The duck breast was cooked to perfection, however the confit leg was small in size and quite dry.  Unlike the starter, he would recommend this dish to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/snapseed-19.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snapseed-19.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="4032" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">We didn't get a dessert as we were far too full, however, we enjoyed a nice gin (mine was a rhubarb, Dave's was grapefruit) and thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. We will 100% be returning again, and whilst it is pricey, you get exactly what you're paying for. Fantastic locally sourced food, cooked with skill and precision, and the friendly and helpful staff are just the cherry on top. Each time we've visited here, we've enjoyed our meals in the bar area which provides a warm and relaxing atmosphere. We have tried to book in the restaurant several times for special occasions, however the tables seem to fill up weeks and weeks in advance! We will get in there eventually.</p>
