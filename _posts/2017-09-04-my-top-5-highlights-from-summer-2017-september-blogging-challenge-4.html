<p style="text-align:center;">There are plenty of things that I have <em>loved</em> this summer. Where do I begin!? I’ve managed to whittle it down to 5 of the best times throughout my summer of 2017.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Mexico<br />
</strong><strong><br />
</strong>I don’t really need to say much more do I? Mexico was booked a year prior to going, so it was definitely a long time coming. Whilst I’ve got to admit that Mexico isn’t my favourite place that I’ve visited, it was such a fantastic holiday. Sun, cocktails, and some quality time with the Mr (not forgetting endless amounts of nachos too!). I didn’t actually start my blog until after the holiday, so I didn’t really take many cool photos or note down any recommendations, but I’ll be sure to on my next years’ hols!</p>

</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Brother’s wedding</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The wedding of the year. My older brother tied the knot this August and it was such a beautiful wedding. From the themed rustic décor, to the breath taking location and views – this really was a fantastic day. The wedding was held at <a href="https://www.ravenhall.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ravenhall Hotel</a> in Ravenscar, and I had the privilege as a bridesmaid to stay over in the lodges the night before, where we sipped prosecco and watched the sun set over the fantastic views. I would 100% recommend this place to anyone as a wedding location. Congrats to my big bro and new sister in law!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Hen parties</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Alongside my brother’s wedding, it was also one of my oldest and dearest friend’s wedding – which meant that I got to go on not only 1, but 2 hen parties. Whilst apprehensive about both, not really knowing the rest of the bridal party/brides friends – both of these weekends were fantastic. You can read all about my hen party planning for my sister in law in my other <a href="http://sophie-amelia.com/2017/07/20/hen-party-planning-on-a-budget/">post</a>. So…another hen party? Anyone?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_8026.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-814" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_8026.jpg" alt="" width="3888" height="2592" /></a><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_1642.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-815" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_1642.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="3780" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>General eating and drinking in the sun</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Nothing screams summer to me than a glass of wine and a ploughman’s board sat in the scorching sunshine. I’m not particularly a beach person, so whenever the hot weather strikes – this is go to favourite thing to do. Whilst I’ve been all over eating and drinking in the sun, one of my favourite little spots has to be the <a href="http://stewandoyster.com/locations/calls-landing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calls Landing - Stew &amp; Oyster</a> &nbsp;in Leeds. Right on the water’s edge, not only is this a fantastic view but a great little sun trap to hide away in and spend the afternoon.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://sophieameliajblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4054.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-817" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_4054.jpg" alt="" width="732" height="937" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Festivals </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">This year with my home town being crowned <a href="http://sophie-amelia.com/2017/07/30/hull-city-of-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City of Culture</a> – there has been a variety of fun festivals to attend. Whilst <a href="http://sophie-amelia.com/2017/08/08/humber-street-sesh-festival-2017-hull-marina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humber Street</a> is a yearly event in Hull prior to the new title, we were lucky enough to have <a href="https://www.hull2017.co.uk/whatson/events/radio-1-big-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radio 1’s Big Weekend</a> at the very own Burton Constable Hall. For a small £8 admin/shipping fee for the tickets, I got to see the likes of Rag n Bone Man, Kasabian and many more for a fantastic weekend. I already can’t wait for more festivals next year!</p>
