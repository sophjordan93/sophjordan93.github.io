<p style="text-align:center;">Weddings are a wonderful thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I absolutely love watching two people celebrate their love for each other surrounded by family, friends, and a good old party. Last weekend was my brother’s wedding – and it was fantastic. Although I was really struggling with one thing… What to buy them for a wedding gift?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Although shops are full of wedding gifts, <em>his</em> and <em>hers</em> glasses etc... I really wanted to get them something special and personal. I came across several personalised items on sites such as <a href="https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/">Not On The High Street</a> (which is one of my favourite sites, but rather pricey), however, I realised I hadn’t allowed myself enough time for the products to be made, delivered, and still needing time to change if needs be.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">As a photo lover myself, I decided to go for something really personal with a photo album. Snapfish have beautifully printed photo albums, but I still felt like I could add my own to it. After all, I graduated with a <a href="http://sophie-amelia.com/2017/08/23/my-nomination-for-the-leibster-award/">degree</a> in Graphic Arts and Design, it would be a waste to not add my creative touch to it!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">My first call was <a href="http://www.hobbycraft.co.uk/">Hobbycraft</a> – I could spend absolutely hours in here. I grabbed myself a bag of scrabble letters to personalise my photo album, and various other foam stickers to decorate my book with. Although I disregarded Snapfish, I did go back to print my individual photos prints.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">I use <a href="https://www.snapfish.co.uk/2/home">Snapfish</a> every time for my photo prints as they are a great cost, quality and don’t take long to arrive either. <em>Tip: if you sign up with a new email, you get so many prints free. Ask around to see if any of your friends/families don’t mind you using their email to get the offer!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Admittedly, it took me a few hours to put everything together, however I was so so pleased with the finished result. I had a beautiful personalised gift all for around £20. Whilst I do love a lot of items in shops, I think customised gifts are so much more personal – and a fraction of the cost too. Who doesn't love a <a href="http://sophie-amelia.com/2017/07/19/date-night-on-a-budget/">budget</a>?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">One of my favourite craft shops is <a href="https://daisydoodlecrafts.co.uk/">Daisy Doodle Crafts</a>, this craft shop is individually run and take personal requests and produce great quality products. I sometimes like to help out with the craft stalls as I love seeing all the things that have been made! Please check out the Daisy Doodle Crafts <a href="https://www.facebook.com/daisydoodlecraft">Facebook page</a> and like and share – Let’s get these individual businesses the recognition they deserve!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Much love,</p>
